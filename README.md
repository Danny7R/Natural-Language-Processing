# Natural Language Processing
IPython notebooks of the most important tasks in natural language processing (NLP) solved using both **classical** and **deep learning** approaches. All are executable in **Google Colab**, for free :)

These notenooks are designed as part of the Natural Language Processing course offered by HSE on Coursera, and contain my own solutions and additions. Every notebook contains cells that download dependencies and installs packages, as well as information that guides you along the way. Decent knowledge of **Python** is, however, required. Many libraries and packages are utilized, including **TensorFlow**, **Scikit-learn**, **NLTK**, **Gensim**, and **StarSpace**.

Just need to follow these simple steps to run each notebook:
1. Go to **https://colab.research.google.com** and sign in.
2. Click on the **GitHub** tab, paste **https://github.com/Danny7R/Natural-Language-Processing** as the URL and press Enter.
3. Choose any of the notebooks you want to work on.
4. To be able to edit and save your progress in **your own** Google Drive, click on **File** -> **Save a copy in Drive**. 
5. Free **GPU**s and **TPU**s are offered too! If you need one, click on **Runtime** -> **Change runtime type** and select **GPU** or **TPU** in Hardware accelerator box.
